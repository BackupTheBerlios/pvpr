# NB:  The timing numbers in this architecture file have been modified
# to comply with our NDA with the foundry providing us with process
# information.  The critical path delay output by VPR WILL NOT be accurate,
# as we have intentionally altered the delays to introduce inaccuracy.
# The numbers are still reasonable enough to allow CAD experimentation,
# though.  If you want real timing numbers, you'll have to insert your own
# process data for the various, R, C, and Tdel entries.

# A simple architecture.  

# All wires span only one logic block, and all routing switches are tri-state
# buffers.
# The logic block is a single 4-LUT + FF.

# Uniform channels.  Each pin appears on only one side.
